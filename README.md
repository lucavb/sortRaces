# sortRaces


this project provides a quick and dirty way to sort the races for the webRowing project.
Also it allows you to disable certain races by clicking on the them. 

## Installation

I switched to jQuery's UI Sortable implementation since it's more responsive. <br />
So please add it. For further information see: https://jqueryui.com/sortable/ <br />
Also please add jQuery (http://jquery.com/). <br />
Updating the ajax.php as to the db connection das appear to be appropiate as well.

## Running it

add the files to your webroot. It does require you to run php as well!
Then just go to the directory and start sorting.
